# Moon Design System icons base repository

Base repository for Moon Design System SVG icons. The aim of this repository is to always be in sync with the current state of the MDS icons Figma [file](https://www.figma.com/file/RDNl9dNTMw2y0LO7K3veak/moon-dev-icon-set?type=design&node-id=4793-543&mode=design&t=UvJQgyCNfpQB9Eft-0). Thus this repository has no versioning nor does it do any post-processing on the icons. Commits to this repository should activate further workflows in MDS technology specific (React, Elixir, Flutter) repositories.
